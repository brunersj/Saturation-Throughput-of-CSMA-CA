Description of the project:
The objective of the project was to simulate the normalized saturation throughput of 802.11's CSMA/CA binary exponential backoff mechanism. 
We did this using NS3, and we compared our results to Bianchi's results. 
We also provide Analytical results that were produced in MATLAB
We compare our simulation results with our analytical results as well.
